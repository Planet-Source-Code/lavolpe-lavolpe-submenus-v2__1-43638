### Description

9,000 hits indicates you liked 1st version. Then, you'll absolutely love this new one. Complete rewrite fixing all known issues w/previous version and adding way too much to this iteration. ScreenShot hilites a lot of it. So heavily remarked it makes up 1/3 of the file size; a 250+kb html help file with pics, a fair sample project and something unique -- an optional user control you can add to your project while in IDE to view menus as they would look in run-time. Has its limitations, but works well. <br> I'm looking for honest feedback, especially pertaining to bugs experienced on your system; this has been tested to death on Win98 & Win2K. I have been testing this for several weeks and each bug found, it seems I added a new feature. Figured if I didn't put this out now, I'd never put it out. Gotta stop sometime to smell the roses. Unzip the help file images to a folder named "ReadMe_files" then put the readme.html in the folder above that. <br> P.S. honest feedback and the "pat on the back" votes keep us going. Thank you in advance. <br> Last updated: 12 Mar/4:15PM Eastern.
